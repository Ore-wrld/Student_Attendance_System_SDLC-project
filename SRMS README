Student Attendance and Performance Tracking System
Project Overview
This project is a no-code Student Attendance and Performance Tracking System developed as part of a Software Engineering (SDLC) course project.
The system demonstrates the full System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) using Microsoft Excel for implementation and Microsoft Word for documentation.
The project replaces manual attendance recording with a simple, accurate, and automated system.

 Objectives
•	To record student attendance accurately
•	To automate attendance calculations
•	To generate attendance summaries and reports
•	To reduce errors associated with manual attendance systems

 Tools Used
•	Microsoft Excel – System implementation
•	Microsoft Word – SDLC documentation
 No programming language was used (no-code approach).

System Description
The Excel system consists of the following worksheets:
•	Students – Stores student details
•	Attendance – Records daily attendance
•	Scores – Stores test and exam scores
•	Summary – Automatically calculates attendance totals and percentages
•	Reports – Describes available reports
Built-in Excel formulas such as COUNTIF, COUNTIFS, SUM, and IF are used to automate calculations.

How to Use the System
1.	Open Student_Attendance_System.xlsx
2.	Enter student details in the Students sheet
3.	Record daily attendance in the Attendance sheet
o	Status must be Present or Absent
4.	Enter scores in the Scores sheet
5.	View automatic calculations in the Summary sheet

Testing
The system was tested using sample student data to verify:
•	Attendance counting
•	Percentage calculations
•	Report accuracy
All tests passed successfully.

 Deployment
The system is deployed by copying the Excel file to the user’s computer.
No installation or configuration is required.

 Maintenance
•	Update student records when necessary
•	Correct data entry errors
•	Perform regular file backups

Academic Note
This project was developed using a no-code SDLC approach to demonstrate system analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance without programming.
